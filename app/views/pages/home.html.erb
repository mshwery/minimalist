      <h3>With you everywhere –</h3>
      <p>The internet makes your lists magically available anywhere. You can access them on your phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>No need to log-in –</h3>
      <p>You don't need an account to use minimaList. Your lists will live at a special url so just bookmark that and you're good to go!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Even better on mobile –</h3>
      <p>This was made mobile-first, so although it's not in the App Store it supports touch gestures like swiping, dragging and tapping.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Simple, Shareable –</h3>
      <p>Anyone you share your link with can access your lists the same as you. Because some lists are better shared (and some are not).</p>
